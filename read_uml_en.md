# Understand UML class diagram and timing diagram

 I will not mention all the elements of UML here, I just want to talk about the relationship between the classes in the class diagram;  
it is enough to understand what the lines and arrows in the class diagram mean. Cope with daily work and communication.  
 At the same time, we should be able to match the meaning expressed by the class diagram with the final code.
With this knowledge, there is no problem looking at the design pattern structure diagram in the following chapter.

 All the graphics in this chapter are drawn using Enterprise Architect 9.2. For all the examples, see design_patterns.EAP in the root directory.

# Start with an example

Please see the following class diagram, the relationship between classes is what we need to pay attention to:
