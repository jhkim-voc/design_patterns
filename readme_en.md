# Graphic design pattern
---

 This book uses a combination of graphics and code to analyze design patterns;

 Each mode has a corresponding object structure diagram.  
At the same time, in order to show the details of the interaction between objects,  
I will use a sequence diagram to explain how it operates;  
 (In the state mode, I will also use the state diagram.  
The use of this diagram Very intuitive for understanding state transitions)

 In order to allow everyone to read UML diagrams,
there will be an article in the front to introduce UML graphical symbols
(see UML class diagrams and timing diagrams);

 After learning the design pattern of the system, we need to reach 3 levels:

1. Can draw all the pattern structures and timing diagrams on white paper;
2. It can be implemented with code; if the code of the pattern has not been implemented, it will not be used; that is, the so-called, understandable, will not be used;
3. Flexible application to work projects;

# Directory structure description
---

This book is written using reStructuredText, you should start from index.rst;

The design_patterns.EAP in the root directory is the EA project file, which contains all the class diagrams and timing diagram examples in the book;

code /: Sample source code for all modes in the book (the project is organized by C-Free and compiled under gcc 4.6.2);

The following three directories explain articles for specific models;

creational_patterns/ structural_patterns/ behavioral_patterns/

_static /: contains all the pictures used in the book;

_build /: html document directory generated by sphnix;

sphinx_rtd_theme /: the theme used for generating html documents;
